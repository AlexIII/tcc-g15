**AWCC - "Alienware Control Center" is an app for thermal control that Dell ships with their G-series notebooks.*

## Target platform

OS: Windows 10/11.

Supported models
- Dell G15: 5511, 5515, 5520, 5525, 5530, 5535.
- Dell Alienware m16 R1

May also work on other Dell G15 / Alienware laptops.

Please report if it worked / didn't work for you. Your feedback is highly appreciated.

## What it can do

- ‚úîÔ∏è Switch thermal mode between G-mode, Balanced and Custom
- ‚úîÔ∏è Shows GPU/CPU temperature and fan speed
- ‚úîÔ∏è Semi-manual fan speed control
- ‚úîÔ∏è An option to automatically enable G-mode when GPU/CPU temperature reaches critical
- ‚úîÔ∏è Support for keyboard G-mode hotkey

## Limitations

- Requires Admin system privileges (in order to access WMI interface)
- Manual fan contoll is not *really* manual. If you set fan speed too low the BIOS will takeover and raise the fan speed automatically when the GPU/CPU temperature reaches certain point to prevent overheating.
- **"Autorun on startup" feature may not work for you.** The autorun adds a task to the Windows Task Scheduler that should start the app on first sign-in after a reboot, but it may fail to run the app due to the system's security policy. You can try other approaches to make the app to autostart on your system. [Checkout this issue.](https://github.com/AlexIII/tcc-g15/issues/7)
- On rare occasions, the driver may report bogus GPU temperature. [See this issue.](https://github.com/AlexIII/tcc-g15/issues/9)
- Switching the thermal mode to "G-mode" and back **may result in second-long system-wide freeze** (in the exact moment when the switch is happening). This is a known issue with the Dell's thermal control interface. Cannot be fixed. Make sure to disable fail-safe feature if you don't want the app to switch the thermal mode automatically.

## Why AWCC is BAD

- ‚ùå AWCC has no in-program option to enable/disable G-mode
- ‚ùå AWCC manual fan control is broken as per this moment
- ‚ùå AWCC is bulky, slow and visually noisy app that can't even handle basic functions
- ‚ùå [AWCC is spying on you](#about-the-awcc-telemetry)
- ‚ùå AWCC sometimes randomly crashes and throws crash reports

If this alternative works out for you, you can safely remove from your PC:

- Alieanware CC Components
- Alieanware Command Center Suite
- Alieanware OC Controls

## How it works

It is a PyQt based GUI for WMI Dell thermal control interface.

I somewhat documented my findings on the WMI [here](WMI-AWCC-doc.md).

## How to run from the source

```
python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
python3 src\tcc-g15.py
```

## About the AWCC telemetry

I know it's probably not gonna surprise anyone, giving the times we're living in, 
but AWCC silently sends some telemetry without the possibility of opting-out.

The telemetry is being sent to these URLs:
